# Personalised-SpotifyPlaylist
This side project involves creating an automated algorithm that analyses my listening habits on Spotify and generates a playlist with my most-listened songs. The algorithm also performs regular updates to make sure that the playlist is up-to-date with my current listening trends.

## New Feature .1: AI song recommender
A new feature has been added to the algorithm where it utilises the songs within the playlist to search and recommend similar songs, which would automatically be added to the playlist itself. This feature is still under development, as its currently being debugged for proper execution.
